                <p class="description__content">
                    I am a 3rd year information technology and engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of
                    Technology. I I am a kind person that enjoys learning new things. I want to learn from more
                    experienced people than myself, so I can advance my skills. I am someone who believes in learning
                    and practicing to achieve what you want. I feel that by joining this internship I will be able to
                    build the base of my future career.

                    As there is no one perfect I have weekness of related to using my time when thing has to go very
                    fast. This comes from my limitation of spending a lot of time on details. This comes out of the
                    curiosity of
                    knowing how things work behind the scenes.Which can be a problem when I need to finish things In
                    short time. I am trying to improve by balancing them. My strengths include: I can learn quickly
                    ,always motivated to learn things and also patient and friendly.
